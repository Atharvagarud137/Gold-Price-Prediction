# Gold-Price-Prediction
This project involves using a Random Forest Regression Model to predict the price of gold based on the previous price range data of gold.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains the historical prices of gold for a specific time period. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any missing values and outliers that could affect the accuracy of the model.

Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and run the gold_price.ipynb file.

The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, and train the Random Forest Regression Model. It will then use the trained model to predict the price of gold for a given input.

To change the input data, update the gld_price_data.csv file.
